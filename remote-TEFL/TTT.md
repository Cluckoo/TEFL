TTT is a structure for the body of a lesson, standing for "Test, Teach, Test".

##### Test
A short stage to check you have the correct difficulty for the teach section. 

You should have backup activities for the case that:
1. Students know less than you thought:
		Backup activity to revise the topic
2. Students know more than you thought:
		Backup activity to be more challenging

##### Teach
Teach the students more about the structure (based on how they did on the first testing section).

Present similar activities to present and practise sections of the [[PPP]] structure:
1. Gap fills
2. SAQs
3. Multiple choice Qs

Introduce students to the meaning, form, and pronunciation of the element and use clear context!

##### Test
Draw attention to what the students have learnt in the lesson.

You can reuse the questions from the first testing stage.
