A good teacher must first create good lessons, which:
1. allows students to practise new skills
2. make students feel they have learned something
3. use interesting teaching materials
4. use a variety of activities
5. link to other lessons logically

But, a good teacher must also deliver these lessons well, by:
1. being patient
2. makes students understand the point of the activities
