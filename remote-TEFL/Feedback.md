Feedback should be a safe space for growth, not overly focused on error correction

There are two types of feedback: direct and indirect.
- Direct = Identify mistake and provide correct form
- Indirect = Mention mistake without identifying it

Tips for good feedback:
1. Give positive verbal feedback
2. Smile and have positive body language
3. Focus on one aspect at a time when giving written feedback

###### BOOST feedback model
- Balanced: positive yet corrective
- Observed: feedback on something you saw the student do
- Objective: feedback should focus on present, regardless of past performance
- Specific: exactly what they did wrong and how to improve
- Timely: give feedback immediately

###### Sandwich feedback
1. Positive feedback
2. Improvements
