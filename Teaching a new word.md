When introducing a new word, you should also teach it's MFP:
1. Meaning = the definition of the word
2. Pronunciation
3. Form
	1. Appropriate prepositions
	2. Plurality
	3. Formality of collocates/idioms
	4. Grammatical classification (type of word)

You should avoid using direct translations from a dictionary because:
1. Sometimes there is no direct translation
2. Students have to work harder and learn better from a fuller explanation
3. It discourages the student from thinking in English

However, dictionaries can be used when student are working independently. However, they may need [[Dictionary training|training on how to use a dictionary first]].
