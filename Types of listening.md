Just like reading, there is extensive and intensive listening. However, there is also interactive and non-interactive listening. Together, there are 4 specific types of listening:

|           | Interactive                          | Non-interactive                         |
| --------- | ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| Extensive | general listening<br>response needed | general listening<br>no response needed |
| Intensive | close attention<br>response needed   | close attention<br>no response needed   |
