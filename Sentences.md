Sentences are a group of words that express a complete idea. They are made of at least one independent clause, but can contain multiple clauses.

##### Types of sentences
The types of clauses found in a sentence define the sentence type:
1. simple (one independent clause)
	- Lisa wanted a new car.
2. compound (two independent clauses)
	- Use coordinating conjunctions (7 types):
		- FANBOYS - for, and, nor, but, or, yet, so
	- They are coming by bus (clause 1) so they should be here soon (clause 2).
3. complex (one independent and one (or more) dependent clauses)
	- Mike went to bed (main clause) because (subordinating conjunction) he was tired.
