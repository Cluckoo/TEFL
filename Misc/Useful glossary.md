Cognates = related words across different languages which **often** have the same meaning

Collocation = a natural combination of words that often appear together in a certain order. E.g., Let's go for TEA and COFFEE (TEA always appears before COFFEE).

Word family = a group of words that typically come from the same root word, sharing a common pattern. E.g., **use**ful, **use**less, **use**able, mis**use**, **use**r. ^0e5156

Count noun: a noun that can be both singular and plural, and be used with the indefinite article ('a'). E.g., lake, bike.

Primary stress (word): the syllable that carries the main stress in a word

Syllable: made with ONLY one vowel sound and multiple consonant sounds. Two vowel sounds cannot be directly adjacent (must have intervening consonant).

Phoneme: any of the perceptually distinct units of sound in a specified language that distinguish one word from another, for example _p_, _b_, _d_, and _t_ in the English words _pad_, _pat_, _bad_, and _bat_.

Allophone: any of the various phonetic realizations of a phoneme in a language, which do not contribute to distinctions of meaning. For example, in English an aspirated _p_ (as in _pin_ ) and unaspirated _p_ (as in _spin_ ) are allophones of the phoneme /p/.

Phonetic transcription: the use of symbols to represent pronunciation. E.g., IPA.
