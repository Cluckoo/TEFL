This a communal box that keeps all the vocabulary cards in one place. It is a useful tool for recycling vocabulary.

You can nominate a student to "scribe" a card, and add extra features such as pronunciation on the card.

You should regularly review the cards, and remove cards that are no longer needed.

The box can be used to play games such as:
1. Mingle-swap (explain card to pair, then once successful swap cards and find new partner)
2. Hot seat
3. Chain story (create story with cards)
4. Positive and negatives (try to argue why your word/phrase is positive or negative)
