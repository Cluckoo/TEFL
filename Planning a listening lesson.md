The standard lesson procedure for a listening lesson is very similar to a [[Planning a reading lesson|reading lesson]]. The stages are the same. 

For a listening lesson, the first three stages need to create a context and allow the listeners to familiarise themselves with the speaker. This is important to allow adjustment to:
- The topic and therefore expected content
- The genre (formality)
- The speaker (intonation and accent)

##### Intensive reading
Just like reading lessons, the main focus in class is on intensive listening. However, connected speech sounds different than each word said individually, making it harder for listeners to use [[Top-down vs bottom-up processing|bottom-up processing]]. Teachers should focus on pronunciation, especially in connected speech!
