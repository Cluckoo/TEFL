Mark stress with a consistent style:
1. Shapes over the word (squares/circles)
2. Dot over the primary stress
3. Underline primary stress
4. Circles after the word
5. Apostrophe (dictionary style)

You can also engage the class when teaching it with:
- Bounce and jump on primary stress
- Clapping
- Whispering and shouting

Make sure to mark stress when teaching new words. Encourage your students to do the same when recording vocabulary.

Teach students how to read the apostrophe in dictionaries so they can find out word stress themselves.
