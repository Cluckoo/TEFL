Games to play with flashcards:

4. Flash (teacher "flashes" the flashcard to the classroom and they say that they saw)
5. "Slowly slowly" (gradual reveal of flashcard, who can guess first)
6. "Magic eyes" (put flashcard in a row on board, say them in order in a rhythm, then overtime remove one and keep reciting while pointing to the empty space instead)
7. Flashcard riddles (show flashcards on board, slowly explain one of them and see if they can guess)
