A needs analysis is for the teacher to understand what the students want/need from the class

It should capture each person's:
1. Learning history
2. Learning aims
3. Current challenges
4. Future challenges

Include open-ended questions for higher level classes

It is also an opportunity to discuss the expected teaching style as some students may expect a lecture style!

Needs analyses can be made into classroom activities such as discussion practice (but students record their answers!)
