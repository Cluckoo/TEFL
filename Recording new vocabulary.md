Students need to see vocabulary between 6-17 times before they remember it. That means they need some way to record new words.

Ideas include:
1. Vocabulary book
2. Vocabulary cards

What to include?
- It is not enough to just have a translation
- It should include:
	- Meaning
	- Classification
	- Pronunciation
	- Collocation examples
	- The word in context
