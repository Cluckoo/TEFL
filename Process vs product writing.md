##### Process writing
- Students plan their written work in class
- Actually write the work as *homework*
##### Product writing
- Students analyse an example text of that style during the class
- Work together during class to produce their own version

##### How to plan a product writing lesson
1. Make students interested
2. Show "end result", and let them analyse
3. Test individuals can reproduce this product
	- Usually a controlled practice to reproduce a section of the final text
4. In pairs/groups, create a first draft
5. Swap drafts for feedback
6. Refine final product!

##### How to plan a process writing lesson
1. Make students interested
2. In groups, brainstorm what to include
3. Individually plan what to include in their text
4. Write first draft (homework)
5. Swap drafts for feedback (monitor feedback as teacher to ensure it's constructive)
6. Write second drafts with feedback (homework)

##### Planning a lesson that mixes both process and product writing
1. The class looks at a model text.
2. Students identify typical features of that type of writing.
3. The teacher sets a task requiring students to produce a piece of writing in the same genre as the model.
4. The class brainstorms useful language to include in their writing.
5. In small groups students plan the organisation and content of their work.
6. Students do the writing individually for homework.
7. The teacher marks homework and highlights mistakes.
8. In class students work in pairs/groups to correct their errors.
9. Students do a second draft of their individual writing for homework.
