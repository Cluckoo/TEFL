Student may learn English for various reasons including for work, study, and or because it is a useful skill. However, in schools they likely need to pass an exam, such as ESOL exams (Cambridge, Trinity, IELTs).

As a teacher, you must create a .... based on the syllabus provided by the school or coursebook used. You should:
1. Familiarise yourself with the examination specifications
2. Explain and teach the exam requirements to the students
3. Keep student morale high with clear, manageable stepping stones in progress
4. Remind students that they must also do independent study to be successful
5. Encourage the development of healthy study habits for students
6. Explain how each activity in your class will help them pass the exam (especially if it isn't obvious
7. Find and use a coursebook made for the exam

| Student insists on taking exam, but isn't ready                      | - spend about half your teaching time on general English pitched at the level you feel the students really need and devote the other half of your teaching time to exam-oriented teaching. Even if most of your students will probably fail the exam this time round, they will be better prepared in the second enrolment)<br>- be frank with parents/employers of students about likely failure to prevent you from getting blamed |
| Students believe they learn by just doing mock exams again and again | - make it very clear from the start how important independent study is. - - introduce them to self-study sites, e.g. Cambridge's Flo-Joe. <br>- look at study skills, such as ways of learning new vocabulary and practising new language.                                                                                                                                                                                           |

#### ESP
Some students may not be trying to pass an exam, but instead learning English for Specific Purposes. In this case, more specialist vocabulary is taught, and students should really have a minimum of B1 level in English.
