This is a [[PPP]]-based plan for speaking lessons specifically

### The three Ts
The first thing to think about before planning the structure of the lesson are the three Ts.
1. Topic (T1) - What will they talk about?
2. Task (T2) - What activity will you use to get them to talk about the topic?
3. Tools (T3) - What language do they need to talk about this topic?

### Stage outlines
##### Stage 1: Introduce the topic (warmer) (T1)

##### Stage 2: Present the TL (T3)
- Select a context
- Elicit the context and develop the situation!
- Choose level-appropriate TL
- Pose questions to prompt target language (TL)
- Elicit (or give) target language (TL), including
	- Forms
	- Vocabulary
##### Stage 3: Provide controlled practice activities
1. Drilling example sentences (for practising pronunciation)
2. Practice activities for getting the form correct (accuracy with pronunciation AND grammar)
	- Correct immediately during this stage
	- Can be written or spoken

##### Stage 4: Set the production task (T2)
- In pairs/small groups, allow students to prepare for a freer speaking activity (e.g. for a debate, role play or simulation)
OR
- Discuss the first part of the speaking task (e.g. for a pyramid discussion). No writing!

- Should recycle TL taught earlier in practice stage
- Correction should be delayed (at end of activity)
- If activity is not straightforward, give students time to prepare what they'll say

Note: functional language lessons can be a good opportunity to teach new, relevant vocabulary. For example, for giving recommendations on travel destinations, country names would be a great Lexus to teach! Make sure to have a resource on the board for this, and pre-teach some of the most important vocab.
##### Stage 5: Do the activity
##### Stage 6: Feedback and correction spot


### Speaking activities ideas
- News reporter
	- Find and present news article in own words
	- For intermediate and above
	- Like you did in French evening language class :)
- Speed-dating
	- Practice getting to know someone politely
- Balloon debates
	Â - Students work in small groups, each one takes on the identity of a famous person. They are in a hot air balloon which cannot carry all of them. One person must be sacrificed so the others can be saved. Each student has to argue why he/she should not have to jump out, then the group votes on who has to go.
- Problem-solving
	- Work in a group to logical problems
	- Can use the "maze" principle: https://www.teachingenglish.org.uk/teaching-resources/teaching-adults/activities/upper-intermediate-b2/holiday-maze
- Ranking activities
	- Pyramid discussion, where first in pairs, then eventually the whole class has to agree on an order of importance for the items given
- Role plays/simulations
- Discussion
	- Simply student/students tell rest of class about a topic
- Presentation
	- Best as homework prepared over the term
	- No script!
- Describing pictures
- Information gap
	- Student has to teach another how to do a task
- Storytelling
	- Either a story made from pictures and words provided
	- Or a personal story
- Instructions
	- In pairs, have to give instructions to complete activity
