As the teacher, you should remember the new words you've taught, and incorporate them in future lessons.

If the students are keeping [[Recording new vocabulary|vocabulary cards]], you can:
- Encourage them to regularly test themselves
- Create a communal classroom [[Vocabulary box]]. Students add to this and test each other.
	- WHAT ABOUT ANKI/ONLINE RESOURCE? Students can contribute digitally
	- Give the students a compiled vocabulary list per week

Vocabulary should be introduced in a **expanding rehearsal/spaced repetition** style. Helpful games for this are on http://iteslj.org/Techniques/Koprowski-RecylingVocabulary.html:
1. Taboo (two teams)
2. Memory challenge
3. Last one standing (one topic, go in circles)
4. Outburst (guess the topic from a list of words)
5. The alphabet game (find word standing with letter in a topic)

Vocabulary can be recycled in both productive and receptive skills lessons.

Productive lessons can have tasks that encourage using certain words:
1. Role/plays/discussions
2. Telling anecdotes
3. Problem-solving activities
4. Writing a story

Receptive lessons:
1. Find a reading with those new words
2. Quiz with the new vocabulary
