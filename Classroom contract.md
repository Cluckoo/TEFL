Typical rules:
- Arrive on time.
- Listen when the teacher or another student speaks.
- Respect each other â€“ do not bully or laugh at anyone.
- Turn off phones.
- Not chew gum.
- Do all homework and hand it in on time.
- Not eat/drink during lessons (up to teacher)
- Raise a hand to speak (if class is big)

You can involve the students in making the classroom contract by prompting them:
- What about phones? Should we have rules for phones?
Then, you can display the rules on the wall, and even get the students to sign it.
Make sure the classroom contract complies with the existing school rules. 

##### Consequences
There need to clear consequences when the contract is broken. You should follow the school's protocol for consequences. Ensure you treat students' fairly, applying the rules equally to the whole class.

Always remember to reward good behaviour. To create an extra platform for awards, you can split the class into two teams for the whole course. Award points whenever XYZ team wins.
