Online resources are great, but sometimes they are difficult to find. As such, you should:
1. Set a time limit for searching for a resource for a specific activity
2. Suggest creating a communal folder with colleagues to store useful websites for activities. This folder should:
	a. have a clear naming and file creation system
	b. be cross-referenced by topic, language, and level
