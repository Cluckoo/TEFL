The difference in emphasis between the syllables of a word is known as **"stress"**. 

There are 3 levels of stress in English: primary, secondary, and completely unstressed syllables. These vary in **loudness, length, and pitch**.

###### Primary stress
- are the syllable that carries the main stress is known as the primary stress.
- There is always only one primary stress in a word.
###### Secondary stress
- are stressed syllables, but less so than primary stress
###### Unstressed syllables
- are quietest
- can sometimes become **disappearing syllables** 
	- ‘chocolate’ can be pronounced Ooo or Oo
- can have changing vowel sounds (reduced vowels), where the vowel becomes /ə/ (schwa sound)
	- London (Lon-Duhn)

A syllable can only contain one vowel sounds, but multiple consonants. In English, two vowels cannot be next to each other; there is always a consonant between vowels.
