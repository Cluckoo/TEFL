4. Based on the above, create a course outline and a scheme of work
5. Develop a variety of engaging digital materials (presentations, worksheets, handouts, quizzes, games, etc.)

During the course, you should:
1. Plan lessons in advance, ideally several lessons in advance
2. Incorporate [[lesson differentiation]].
