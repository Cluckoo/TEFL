A part of the clause that conveys information about time, manner or place – when, how or where something is done – is called an _**adverbial**_. It could be a single word or a phrase. Adverbial phrases often begin with a preposition, **e.g**. on to the table.

##### Adverbials vs adverbs
Adverbs are just single-word versions of adverbials
- All adverbs all adverbials. 
- Adverbials are words/phrases/clauses that function as an adverb
