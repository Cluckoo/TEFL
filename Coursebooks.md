You should choose a course book AFTER conducting a [[Needs analysis]]. You can "preview" a coursebook by finding the contents page called the "scope and sequence" online. You can then decide what to add/take away to adapt it to your students

| - Usually provides a clearly structured programme of study, incorporating practice and revision.<br>    <br>- Materials are appropriately graded.<br>    <br>- Saves teacher preparation time.<br><br>- Usually provides a wide range of different materials.<br>    <br>- Usually consists of the student coursebook, workbook/CD and teacher's book, so plenty of materials and guidance are provided.<br>    <br>- Comes with listening materials. | - The need to 'get through' the book is constricting.<br>    <br>- No coursebook will precisely match the language needs and interests of a particular class.<br>    <br>- Discourages the teacher from experimenting with materials and teaching approaches.<br>    <br>- Can mean that the teacher relies on the book and does not plan lessons carefully to suit the needs of students.<br>    <br>- The layout of each module/unit in a coursebook tends to be the same; hence, it can become boring and predictable. |

| - Provides a record of what they've done and what they are going to do.<br>\|<br>- Acts as a reference book.<br><br>- Useful for revision.<br><br>- Provides a sense of security – a coursebook often seems more authoritative than just a selection of materials provided by the teacher.<br><br>- Provides exercises (in the book, workbook and often online) that the students can do independently.<br><br>- If the student misses a lesson, it is easier for them to catch up. | - Students may have to pay extra for the book.<br><br>- May not have access to audio or visual recordings.<br><br>- Because it is aimed at a very general group of students, it may contain grammar and vocabulary that is too easy or too difficult.<br><br>- Topics covered may not be relevant or interesting. |
## Using the coursebook well
The coursebook will have too much material to cover completely. You must select the most relevant parts to both keep students interested and not overload them!

| Problem                                          | Solution                                                                        |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Main topic of unit is boring                     | Choose a different topic with:<br>- another coursebook<br>- your own materials  |
| Students already know main grammar point of unit | Skip it                                                                         |
| Reading texts have lots of unfamiliar vocab      | Pre-teach vocabulary in lesson before or with homework<br>OR<br>Substitute text |
| Unit exercises don't recycle language            | Create your own revision activities                                             |
| Grammar point poorly explained                   | Create own materials to present grammar                                         |
| Listening dialogue is inauthentic                | Find subsitute<br>OR<br>Record your own dialogue with colleague                 |

If an activity is boring but still fits the aim, be creative and alter it to make it more interactive! Always try to make coursebook activities more interactive!

Ensure you make the coursebook feel personalised by supplementing the activities. For example, if a speaking activity has topic X, start a classroom discussion on topic X before beginning the activity. Also, you can change the materials to realia!
