##### Music
Idea from the Teacher's room
1. Generate interest by:
	- Giving title/ lyrics of song and ask students to guess meaning
	- On first listen, allow students to write anything they want, including any feelings or impressions about the song
	- Allow students to discuss
2. Actual task
	1. Lyrics gap fill
		- Remove key lyrics related to lesson focus
		- Give students sheet with missing words
		- Students listen and fill words they can hear
		- Can use clues/pictures/definitions if difficult
	2. Lyric scramble
		- Cut up lyrics into sections, and "scramble" them
		- Ask students to reorder them
		- To make more difficult, play song for 20s, then stop for 20s. Students cannot touch lyrics while song is playing!
		- Can also use pictures to represent lines, and students order pictures instead
3. Have fun, sing together

##### Movies
- Never use translated movies
- Good to pre-teach vocabulary
- Break up movie into snippets

Ideas from https://www.britishcouncil.org/voices-magazine/five-tips-using-authentic-video-classroom
1. You may use more advanced audio, if you ensure the task is easier.
	- E.g., Play a newscast, a Shakespeare play, and a football match. Then ask students to tell you which is which. Then encourage them to describe the three different texts, the sounds of the speakers’ voices, and so on.
