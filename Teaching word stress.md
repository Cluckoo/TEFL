When teaching stress, you need to make it physical. E.g., clap the stressed syllables while saying the word. Make sure **NOT** to clap the unstressed ones.

You should also write the word with [[Marking word stress|clearly marked stress]]. Never use capital letters as this can make the student believe that's how you write the word.
