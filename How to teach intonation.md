1. Include intonation in speaking activities, and make it fun!
2. Provide activities that encourage use of certain intonations. E.g., different types of Qs
3. Provide accurate examples/models

Activities:
1. Hum the sentence
2. Say the same sentence with different emotions, guess the emotion.
	Extended idea: get students to write mini dialogues. Have them annotate the dialogue with emotions and then practise the intonation.
3. Contrastive stress; correct me. One person says a sentence, and the other deliberately repeats back the information incorrectly. The speaker must then emphasise the appropriate word to "correct" the misunderstanding.




###### Why teach intonation?
- Intonation conveys the emotion behind our words
- Incorrect intonation can make speakers sound bored or impolite
- English questions have the feature where not all questions have rising intonation
- The student can choose how they want to be perceived. For example, a wider range of intonation is perceived as friendlier in English. However, this might be embarassing for students who come from languages where this isn't the case.
