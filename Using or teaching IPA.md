This is entirely optional, but can be helpful, especially if the students are familiar with it

General advice:
1. Don't teach more than 4-6 symbols in one go
2. Use easy vocabulary that students are already familiar with to illustrate which sounds the symbols represent.
3. Put the IPA sounds in words and sentences
4. Continue to sprinkle in taught symbols in throughout future lessons
