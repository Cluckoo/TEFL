To help with understanding the differences between sounds in a language, you can focus on the following:

##### 1. Where does the sound come from? (ARTICULATION)
##### 2. Is the jaw open or closed? (VOWEL HEIGHT/OPENNESS)
##### 3. What shape is the mouth? (LIP ROUNDING)
##### 4. Where is the tongue? (TONGUE POSITION)
##### 5. Does sound come out of my mouth? (ORAL VS NASAL)
##### 6. Is it voiced? (do your vocal cords vibrate) (PHONATION
- E.g., BOUNCE VS POUNCE (/b/ and /p/)
