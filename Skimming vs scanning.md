These refer to two types of ways we quickly read a text:

##### Skimming
- When you quickly read to get a general idea (gist) of the text
- E.g., skimming a book's blurb to decide whether to buy it

##### Scanning
- When you quickly read to find a specific piece of information
- E.g., Allergens on a food product

Overall, scanning is not an effective way to get the overall meaning of a text, but it is still a useful skill for students to develop.
