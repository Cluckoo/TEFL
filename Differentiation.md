Differentiation: Methods a teacher can use to support students with different needs in the same class

Reasons why differentiation is needed:
1. Different first languages
2. Educational backgrounds
3. Varying motivations

Differentiation strategies:
- Assessing students to gauge their levels
- Group students by shared interests

We can improve differentiation with:
1. Awareness and use of [[Paralinguistic features]]
2. Catering to [[Monolingual vs multilingual classes]]
