Objects are the "recipient" of the action done by the subject. Often, clauses can contain 2 objects. This is because there are different types of object.

##### Direct and indirect objects
1. Direct objects: The recipient of the action of the verb
2. Indirect objects: The recipient of the direct object
- The object which can be preceded by a preposition is the indirect object (IO) and the object that the subject has direct contact with is the direct object (DO)
- When 2 objects are in a clause, they follow the structure of S-V-O-O
