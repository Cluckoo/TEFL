If you find that the class has students with a mix of abilities, it is NOT a good idea to pitch the level right in the middle.

Instead, be mindful of which students you pair or group together. Mix up:
1. grouping students with mixed ability, so that the stronger ones can help
2. grouping students BASED on ability, so that stronger students work with stronger students, and weaker students with weaker students.

Doing only no.1 may make students feel like they are being "used" as teaching tools. 

However, doing no.2 allows you to create tasks that can be adapted to be different difficulties, i.e., differentiation. E.g., 
1. For low level students the teacher could ask them to draw a rectangle, this could represent a bedroom. Then ask the students to draw a window and a door where they want in the wall.
2. For lower-level students ask them to draw a bed, a desk, a wardrobe, a tv, a chair. For higher level students, add more elements to the room. 
3. Once students have done this, put them in pairs. They take turns to dictate their drawings to their partners. They then compare their work.


#### General tips for tasks
- If you know students will finish at different times, plan for extra activities for faster students
- Or, create a big worksheet, and allocate groups of students to do different parts, and if some students from group A finish quickly, they can start on group B questions.
