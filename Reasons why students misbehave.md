#### Adults
###### 1. The student feels dissatisfied with your teaching.
- Find out what students want from the class
- If one student is unhappy, inform them that content was decided democratically
- Listen to genuine criticism
###### 2. The student has taken a personal dislike to you.
- Be culturally sensitive
###### 3. The student feels s/he is in the wrong class.
- If student's skill level is not appropriate, move them to correct class
- If they are only strong in some skills, let them know that their XYZ skills are not as good as the rest of the class
- If no room to move student, try to cater for range of abilities
###### 4. The student has a problem with one of the other students in the class.
- Don't put them together for pair/group work
###### 5. The student is just a difficult person with personal problems.
- Go to manager/director of studies

#### Children
###### 1. Your teaching style is unfamiliar (most likely cause).
- Observe local teacher's teaching style to adapt to the students
###### 2. If you are teaching in a country where the education system is generally very strict, your students may feel that your more 'liberal' style of teaching means that you are a 'softy' and that they can get away with behaving badly in your classes.
###### 3. They may be used to a more old-fashioned style of teaching in which they are generally not expected to speak unless the teacher asks them a direct question. Hence, they find some of the interactive communicative activities used in EFL teaching unfamiliar and embarrassing. This might cause them to either misbehave or refuse to participate.
###### 4. They may feel that your lessons consist of just a load of fun and games and, therefore, cannot be 'serious'.
