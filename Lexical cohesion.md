This is repeating or using related words. There are two main types:
1. Reiteration
	- the repetition of the same word or synonyms for that word throughout the text.
	- technically includes: repetition, synonymy, antonymy, hyponymy, meronymy…
2. Collocation
	-  the use of words and phrases from the same lexical field (i.e. topic)
	- essentially, when writing about a topic, there is a tendency for words to co-occur
