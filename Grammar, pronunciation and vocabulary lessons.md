###### Grammar lessons
As well as the tenses, also focus on MFP:
1. Meaning
2. Form (how to construct)
3. Pronunciation
###### Pronunciation
- Individual sounds
- Word stress
- Sentence stress
- Intonation
- Features of connected speech 
###### Vocabulary
As well as teaching the word itself, also teaching what it collocates with (contextual meaning). For example:
- **Run** a marathon vs **Run** a bath

At more advanced levels, teaching [[Phrasal verbs]] and idioms should be taught.

Focus on MFP, where 'Form' refers to spelling and grammatical category.
