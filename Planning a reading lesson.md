##### Preparing resources
- First, you should find a resource 
	- Coursebook
	- Authentic resource
	- Self-made
- Next, you should check the level of the vocabulary to decide which words to focus on. Select a maximum of 10 words/phrases that are at or above the level of the class, or those that are unlisted. These words should be essential to understanding the text.

- You should then decide how to pre-teach your selected vocabulary. Decide for each word:
	- Images
	- Realia
	- Eliciting
	- Other activities


##### Stage 1
- Teach each word as you decided before. However, keep MFP in mind. Students should note:
	- Meaning
	- Grammatical category
	- Spelling
	- Pronunciation (including stressed syllables)
- Optionally, move onto vocabulary consolidation activities for the vocab you just taught
	- Gap-fill
	- Definition matching exercise
