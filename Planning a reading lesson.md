A standard reading lessons follows [[Reading lesson structure|this structure|]]. See [[Reading lesson example|here]] for a complete example lesson plan.
##### Preparing resources
- First, you should find a resource 
	- Coursebook
	- Authentic resource
	- Self-made
- Next, you should check the level of the vocabulary to decide which words to focus on. Select a maximum of 10 words/phrases that are at or above the level of the class, or those that are unlisted. These words should be essential to understanding the text. Without this, students may be overwhelmed and fixate on the new vocabulary.

	- You should then decide how to pre-teach your selected vocabulary. Decide for each word:
	- Images
	- Realia
	- Eliciting
	- Other activities

The first two stages are pre-reading stages. You are preparing learners for the text.

##### Stage 1 (warmer)
- Introduce the topic and choose an activity to get them started:
	- Picture of topic on board
	- Broad questions, perhaps personal
	- Best done in groups

##### Stage 2 (pre-teach vocab)
- Teach each word as you decided before. However, keep MFP in mind. Students should note:
	- Meaning
	- Grammatical category
	- Spelling
	- Pronunciation (including stressed syllables)
- Optionally, move onto vocabulary consolidation activities for the vocab you just taught
	- Gap-fill
	- Definition matching exercise

##### Stage 3 (First quick read)
- Let the students read the text and devise questions which encourage them to [[Skimming vs scanning|skim and scan]] the text. 
- Set a strict time limit
- Devise two questions:
	1. Skimming question: a specific question that forces the reader to infer the general sentiment of the text. 
		- *Come up with a title for the text*
		- *Is the writer happy or sad about the situation he describes?*
	2. Scanning question: a question which asks the reader to find a specific detail. 
		- *How much money did he win?*

PROVIDE FEEDBACK ON FIRST READ

##### Stage 4 ([[Extensive vs intensive reading|intensive reading]])
- Let the students read the text for a second time, but let them read it for longer, and provide a task that forces them to focus on details and interpret them:
	- [[Designing comprehension questions]]
	- Low level students: simple scanning questions
	- "What's wrong with the sentence?" activity
	- Advantages and disadvantages questions
	- What/why/how did X do Y?
	- How similar is the writer's views to yours?

PROVIDE FEEDBACK ON SECOND READ

##### Stage 5 (follow-on activities)
- Activities which consolidate the understanding of the topic and the new vocabulary. Usually involves speaking.
	- Similar to warmer, can shift the topic to how they personally feel about the topic/ what do they do?
	- Roleplays
	- Debates
	- Lower level students:
		- Complete the sentence (provide only the stems of sentences)
		- "Ask me more" game, where students write facts about themselves and after sharing one, other students have to ask as many questions as possible
		- The witness game: specific roleplay where a "witness" must describe to a "police officer" the description of the "criminal". From the photos, the "police officer" has to guess the criminal.
		- Gap-fill exercise the vocabulary in new sentences
- ###### Freer practice stage
	- The final activity can be a "freer practice stage", where you let student discuss/roleplay in pairs/groups a broad question, but that is on topic and encourages a specific grammatical form

#### Part 2 of lesson: grammar
Often, the first part of the lesson can be reading and comprehension, and then using the same text, the following part can be about grammatical structures
