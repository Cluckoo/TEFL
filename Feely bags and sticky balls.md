#### Feely bags
Students describe what they feel in the bag/box

**Step 1:** The teacher could put an object such as a stone into a bag.

**Step 2:** The students put their hands into the bag one by one and use English words to describe what they feel. 

In the example of the stone, the students might say it feels hard, cold or smooth. This is a great way to get students to speak, but the usefulness of the feely bag as a teaching aid is limited.

##### Sticky balls

**Step 1.**  Put a list of new vocabulary words on the board.

**Step 2.** Let a student throw the sticky ball at a word on the board and then say that word. 

Introducing a point system makes the game even more entertaining for the students. Using a sticky ball allows the students to let off some steam in a focused way that relates to the lesson. It is especially suitable for younger learners.
