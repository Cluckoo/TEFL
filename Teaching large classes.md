To still provide functional language practice to a large class, you must divide the class into groups based on level at the START of the course:
1. Conduct a placement test to see everyone's ability
2. Divide class into groups which have at least one strong student
3. Give each student in each group a number
4. These groups are now for the rest of the course

It is impossible to mark homework frequently for a big class. Here, you should opt for as much peer-marking as possible!

#### How to use groups in practice
During group activities such as discussion practice, you can ask "Student 3 from each group will report what their group said". 

As you monitor the groups, try and learn all the students' names (can use name cards), and note which students have contributed something
