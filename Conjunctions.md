A **conjunction** is a **word** used to **connect clauses** or **sentences** or to **coordinate words** in the same clause. Conjunctions are also referred to as **Linking words** or **connectives**, though these categories are broader than conjunctions (some connectives are not conjunctions).

##### The functions of a conjunction
1. Linking words together within the same clause
	- Jason **and** Jack came to my house
2. Linking whole clauses together
	- We stayed home **because** it was raining
3. Linking ideas across two sentences
	- You lied to me. Yet, you still want to stay together?

##### The three basic meanings of all conjunctions
Most conjunctions have the same basic meaning as either:
1. and
2. or
3. but

##### Different categories of conjunctions
- **Addition**: also, so, as well, in addition
- **Result/Cause:** so (that), because, because of
- **Conditions:** if, if not, unless
- **Alternatives:** either... or, alternatively, another possibility, on the other hand
- **Concession:** (One statement is surprising/unexpected in view of the other, e.g. He's always rude to her but she seems to be totally in love with him.) although, even though, even so, in spite of, despite, nevertheless.
- **Contrast:** however, on the other hand, whereas, while

##### Conjunctions for time
- Some conjunctions relate ideas in chronology
	- I woke up late, **then** I missed the bus
	- since, ever since, when, as soon as, while.
##### Conjunctions and collocations
- Conjunctions demand specific syntax and collocations
- Because is interchangeable at the start of middle of the sentence. Despite "so" having the same meaning, it cannot be used at the start of the sentence:
	- I stayed at home because I was feeling unwell
	- Because I was feeling unwell, I stayed at home.
	
	- I was feeling unwell, so I stayed at home
	- ==So I was feeling unwell I stayed at home==
