- Establish clear expectations, preferably ones agreed upon by the students.
- Have clear consequences for breaking the agreed rules.
- Reward and praise good behaviour â€“ focus on this more than on punishing bad behaviour.
- Try to ensure that everyone feels comfortable and that they are being fairly treated.
- If problems do arise, deal with them straight away. Ignoring them does not generally make them go away!
