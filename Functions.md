A language function explains why someone says something, and what the goal of the information communicated is. 

Many phrases can fall under the same function, all with varying formalities and nuances. These are called [[Functional exponents]]. Hence, using the appropriate phrase to fulfil a function is heavily context-dependent.

Some functions include:

|Language Function|Exponent|
|---|---|
|Offering something|Would you like some (cake)?|
|Refusing an invitation|I’d love to, but (I’m working).|
|Promising|I'll (be there).|
|Warning|(Look out), or you’ll (fall).|
|Inviting|Would you like to (see a movie)?|
|Asking for information|Could you tell me (where the station is)?|
|Giving advice|If I were you, I’d (get a new phone).|
|Making suggestions|Let’s (get something to eat).|
|Giving opinions|I’d say (it’s a great idea).|
|Agreeing|I totally agree with you.|
|Disagreeing|Yes, I see what you mean, but (it’s too expensive).|
|Prohibiting|Sorry, you can’t (eat in the classroom).|
|Making logical deductions|He must have (forgotten about the meeting).|
Functions are not a comprehensive categorisation of language. There is a lot of overlap between which function a phrase belongs to. It's use is to help students understand language holistically.
