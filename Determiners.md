_Determiners_ are words that come before nouns and specify something about their quantity, definiteness, or ownership. They used to be seen as a subcategory of adjectives. A determiner MUST be followed by a noun/noun phrase. Determiners are often the first word in a noun phrase. 

##### Types of determiner
1. **Articles:** a, the
2. **Demonstratives:** this, that
3. **Possessive adjectives/possessive determiners:** my, our*
4. **Interrogative adjectives/interrogative determiners:**  what, which, whose
5. **Quantifiers:** some, a few, several

##### Possessive determiners (adjectives)
- Demonstrate ownership of the noun

|**Subject**|**Object**|**Possessive adjective**|
|---|---|---|
|I|me|my|
|you|you|your|
|he|him|his|
|she|her|her|
|it|it|its|
|we|us|our|
|they|them|their|
##### Quantifiers
These are also determiners, and include the articles "a" and "the", because these two indicate quantity. "A person" is one person! Some other examples of quantifiers include:
- all, some, no, loads of, few

Quantifiers can only go with appropriate nouns (uncountable vs countable). You couldn't say "A few rice".

Sometimes, some noun phrases [[Indefinite vs definite articles|omit an article]], and as such have no determiner.
