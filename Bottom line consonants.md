The third row of consonants on the [[IPA in English|phonetic chart]] are the leftovers that are neither [[plosives]] nor [[fricatives]]. These consonants are all voiced. The first three consonants are nasal.

Each has a distinct articulation:

| Sound                  | Type of consonant | Place of articulation                              |
| ---------------------- | ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| /m/, /n/ and /ŋ/       | Nasal             | /m/ = bilabial<br>/n/ =  alveolar<br>/ŋ/ = velar   |
| /h/                    | Fricative         | Glottal                                            |
| /l/, /r/, /w/, and /j/ | Approximant       | /l/, /r = alveolar<br>/w/ = velar<br>/j/ = palatal |
Approximants are between fricatives and vowels. The articulators come together, but less so than  a fricative, such that there is no obstruction of air flow (no hissing sound).

Voiceless consonants take on the shape of the ensuing vowel. For example, /h/ in heat, hit, hook, hoot, head, hurt, hall, hat, hut, heart, hot does not have its own shape, while /b/ does beat, bit, book, boot, bed, Bert, bat, but Bart, Bombay.
