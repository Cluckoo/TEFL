Reading lessons can be divided into three main stages:
1. Before reading
2. During reading
3. After reading

During each stage certain activities will help the students engage more with the reading:

### Reading activities
##### Before reading
1. Students read the first line and predict the content of the text
2. Create a list of keywords of the text. Halve the keywords between the class. In partners, students explain their keywords to each other
3. Use visuals related to the text and ask the students to discuss them
4. Students come up with questions based on the topic of the text, and then ask each other in groups

##### During reading
- Divide the text in half. Each student only reads half the text and must work in pairs to construct the meaning of the whole text. This can be done by simply cutting the text in half or by cutting it at random places—which method is best will depend on the text.
- Let the students come up with questions from the text which their partners must then answer.
- Take out a number of sentences from the text. While they read, the students must put them back in the correct place. This can also be done with words instead of sentences.

##### After reading
- Students answer questions which will relate the text to the students’ lives.
- The students can present a follow-up to the text—what happened next?
- The students can write a letter to the editor commenting on the text.

##### General reading activities
###### Beginners
1. Word cards: put the cards in the right order
2. Match words and pictures: in partners or as a memory game

###### Intermediate
1. Jumbled sentences: put sentences in correct order
2. Jumbled paragraphs: put the paragraphs in the right order
3. Simulations:
	**Step 1.** Set up the situation. Students familiarise themselves with the situation by reading a text or texts.  
	**Step 2.** Each student is then allocated a role within the scenario. They read their role cards.  
	**Step 3.** Students then communicate with each other while attempting to accomplish a task.

4. Scan: retrieve specific information from the text
5. Skim: summarise the gist of the text
6. Jigsaw: 
	1. Divide class into small groups (don't have to sit together)
	2. Give each group their own reading task (either parts from same text, or similar texts)
		- For similar level students', can divide up a single text
		- For mixed-level, give advanced students a harder text, and beginners an easier one
	3. Set a question to create a goal for the student's to read the text. Tell them they'll have to report their answers to a partner
	4. Put students' in same group together
	5. Groups discuss and decide on most important information, and create notes on what to teach the other group
	6. Create new groups where at least one member has reach each text. The members teach each other about their texts
	7. 
##### Advanced
1. Criticise: read text then write a summary or critique
2. Discuss
3. Identify the reader's attitude
4. Read by yourself, then discuss as a class
