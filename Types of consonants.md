### 1. **Plosives**
- **Definition**: Consonant sounds made by **blocking the airflow completely** in the vocal tract, building up pressure, and then **releasing it suddenly**.
- **Examples in English**: /p b t d k g/ (as in _pat, bat, top, dog, cat, go_).

### 2. **Fricatives**
- **Definition**: Consonants made by **narrowing the space** between two articulators so air flows through with **friction** (a hissing or buzzing).
- **Examples in English**: /f v θ ð s z ʃ ʒ h/ (as in _fun, very, thin, this, see, zoo, ship, measure, hat_).

### 3. **Affricates**
- **Definition**: A combination of a **plosive + fricative**: the sound starts with a complete closure, then releases into friction.
- **Examples in English**: /tʃ dʒ/ (as in _church, judge_).

### 4. **Nasals**
- **Definition**: Consonants where the **oral cavity is blocked**, but the **velum (soft palate) is lowered**, letting air flow out through the nose.
- **Examples in English**: /m n ŋ/ (as in _man, net, sing_).

### 5. **Approximants**
- **Definition**: Consonants made when articulators come close together but **not enough to cause friction** — almost like vowels.
- **Examples in English**: /r j w l/ (as in _red, yes, we, let_).
