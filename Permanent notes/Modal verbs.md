##### Rules of modals
- do not have past or participle forms
- don't have a set meaning
- don’t use _do/does/did_ for negatives or questions (_Can she drive?_ / _She can’t drive_).
- Many modal verbs have “past” forms (could, would, might, should), but they often express **politeness, tentativeness, or hypothetical meaning** rather than real past time.
##### Types of modal verbs
There are 9 types
1. will
2. would
3. shall
4. should
5. can
6. could
7. may
8. might
9. must
10. 
Need and dare are also sometimes included as modals.


Teaching: **you should introduce modal verbs very gradually, one function at a time.**
