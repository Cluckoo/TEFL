##### Context
- Approach to language teaching proposed by group of linguists commissioned by the European Council for Cultural Cooperation to "investigate and propose improvements to modern foreign language teaching" in the early 1970s.
- Book called Notional Syllabuses (Wilkins, 1976) came out. This led to emergence of CLT.
- Communicative Language Teaching has a functional view of language learning: language is a way of doing things in the real world. CLT developed lists of ‘functions’ students need to learn, such as how to make a request, how to invite someone somewhere, or how to express an opinion.
##### What is it?
- Goal of language teaching and learning is communicative competence
- Grammatical accuracy is seen as less important than the successful communication of meaning.
- Belief that grammatical competence will be acquired through the use of language for communicative purposes.
- A CLT lesson typically has three main stages (PPP).
	1. Students learn some ‘target language’ (vocabulary, grammar or expressions).
	2. Then, students practise the target language orally in pairs, until they can use it correctly.
	3. Finally, students interact in a life-like activity, such as a role-play, to develop fluency.
