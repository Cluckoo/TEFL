Students complete an accuracy-based activity that focuses on the meaning, form and pronunciation. E.g.,
1. Gap fills
2. SAQs
3. Multiple choice Qs
##### Produce
Students complete activities that allow them to express themselves such as:
1. Open-ended questions
2. Role-plays
3. Writing activities

It can be helpful to remind students of the component you're trying to teach before starting the produce stage.
