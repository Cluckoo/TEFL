Don't use phonetic symbols for everything. Highlight an odd spelling in English with the IPA symbol to make it clear:
- photo
- /f/

If your accent is different to the written pronunciation, just point it out to the student. No need to change your accent!

Make pronunciation physical by:
- demonstrating it with your mouth!
- draw a diagram on the board

##### Teaching diphthongs
- **/eə/** (hair) and  **/ɪə/** (beer) are often hard for students
- Remind them your tongue moves since you are making two sounds (two vowels)
- Do a speak and hear exercise.
	- Record you speaking a list of words
	- Have students listen and record themselves
	- Listen, and find words they struggle with
	- Do exaggerated practise (split up the diphthong)
	- Do diphthong bingo (students have to differentiate to correctly score off words)
##### Teaching consonants /w/ and /v/
- Highlight that in /r/, the tongue is in a similar position to /d/, but does not make contact. But with /l/, the tongue makes contact with the alveolar ridge.
- Do this activity:
	- To understand /r/, tell them to say 'aaah' and then curl their tongue back – demonstrate with your hands how the tongue should move
	- To understand /r/. Get your students to say 'la-la-la-la'. Use your hands to demonstrate the position of the tongue in relation to the teeth. They should be able to feel their tongue touching their mouth behind their top teeth.

##### Teaching consonants /w/ and /v/
- /w/ is formed with rounded lips. You can help students by getting them to move from the /u:/ sound to the /ə/ sound (schwa). If they say these quickly, they form a /w/.
##### Teaching consonants /dʒ/ and /j/
- In both, the body of the tongue is raised up to the roof of the mouth, with the sides of the tongue against the back teeth.
- Highlight that for /dʒ/, the tip of the tongue is pressed against the roof of the mouth so that it stops the air, for /j/ it is curled back and makes no contact or only slight contact with the roof of the mouth.
