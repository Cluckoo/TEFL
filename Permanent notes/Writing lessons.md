Teaches different types of writing styles (email, letter, essay), focusing on the differences in their register and tone. Students are made aware of the punctuation, spelling, paragraphing, organisation, and linking phrases

2. Students practise writing parts of a text in that tone
3. Give students a task where they plan a whole text
4. Students write the whole text
