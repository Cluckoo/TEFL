Sentence forms refer to the **different ways a sentence can be structured to express meaning**. In English, we usually divide them into three main types:

- **Affirmative (positive)** – a statement that says something is true.
    - _She is a teacher._
        
- **Negative** – a statement that says something is not true, usually with **not** or contracted forms.
    - _She is not a teacher._ / _She isn’t a teacher._
        
- **Interrogative (question form)** – a sentence that asks something, often by inverting the subject and auxiliary verb.
    - _Is she a teacher?_
        
These forms can be applied across all **tenses** in English.
