##### Context
- Focus on student output rather than input
- Not a language teaching approach in itself, but rather the application of competency-based education to language teaching.
##### What is it?
- What students need to learn is broken down into individual 'competencies', each of which a student should master before moving on to the next one.
- The approach considers the various situations, such as work and social situations, in which students will need to use English and the types of meaning they might need to convey.

### Example (_extract from the ESOL entry-level 1 curriculum which is used for adult immigrants in the UK._)

**Component skill, knowledge and understanding:**   

1. Engage in discussion

2. Speak and listen in simple exchanges and in everyday contexts

3. Adults should learn to take part in social interaction. **They should be able to:**

(a) greet: Hi, how are you?

(b) respond to a greeting: Fine, thanks. And you?

(c) introduce others: This is Joe, and this is Sam. They're brothers.

(d) invite and offer (e.g. using would like): Would you like a sandwich? Yes, please.

(e) accept and decline invitations and offers: Would you like a ham sandwich? - No, thanks. I'm sorry. I don't eat ham.
