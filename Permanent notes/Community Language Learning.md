##### What is it?
- Method for small classes (max 12)
- Teacher is the "knower".
- Follows this procedure:
	- When an individual student is ready to say something, they say it to the knower in L1, and the knower translates the message into L2.
	- The student repeats the translation while the rest of the class listens until the teacher feels it is being produced adequately. 
	- The student then addresses the message to another student. The same procedure would then be followed for that student's response
