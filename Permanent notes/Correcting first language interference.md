First language interference: when a speaker's mother language negatively impacts their acquisition of another. This includes pronunciation, where certain sounds in English may not exist in their native tongue.

One method is using minimal pairs to highlight the differences between sounds
##### Minimal pairs
- A minimal pair is a pair of words where only one sound differs
- Minimal pairs can differ at different points of the word
	- First sound (sad v mad)
	- Second sound (bad v bud)
	- Third sound (bat v bang)
	- etc...
- An activity is as follows:
	1. Give students a list of minimal pairs which contain sounds that are similar, and are therefore confusing the students
	2. Teacher reads one from a pair, and the student marks which he thinks was said
	3. Check answers, if wrong, demonstrate how to form the sound. Repeat until understood
	4. Repeat for all pairs of words
	5. Let students do activities in pairs, and monitor them

##### General advice:
1. Present the word in spoken form before written
2. Bring awareness to the effect of **stress, rhythm and intonation** on pronunciation
3. Use activities which match sounds to words
4. Use IPA appropriately
