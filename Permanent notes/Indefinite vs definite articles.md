The three articles in English are "the", "a", and "an".
- definite = the
- indefinite = a, an

When we use each is dependent on three rules and whether they describe a countable or uncountable noun


| Rule | Countable    | Uncountable  |
| ---- | ------------ | ------------ |
| 1    | a, an        | (no article) |
| 2    | the          | the          |
| 3    | (no article) | (no article) |

##### Rule 1: Specific identity of the noun is unknown
You use "a/an" here, and if plural, you use "some".
- _I think **an** animal is in the garage_
- _I think **some** animals are in the garage_

##### Rule 2: Specific identitiy of the noun is known
You use "the" in all cases here. 
- When a particular noun has already been mentioned
	- _I ate **an** apple yesterday. **The** apple was juicy and delicious._
- When an adjective/phrase/clause clarifies the noun's identity
	- _**The** boy sitting next to me raised his hand._
- The noun is unique
	- _**the** 2003 federal budget_
##### Rule 3: All things in general
You use no article here
- _I do not like coffee_
- _Trees are beautiful in the fall._
