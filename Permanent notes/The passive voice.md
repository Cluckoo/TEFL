The active voice is when the subject of the sentence performs the action. However, the passive voice is when the focus is instead placed on the object.

##### When to use the passive
1. Passive sentences are often used when the person doing the action is unknown or unimportant. In this case, we usually leave off the subject as in the example by someone.
	- Someone robbed the bank. (active)
	- The bank was robbed by someone. (passive)
2. To place more emphasis on the object
	- The song “Ziggy Stardust” was written by David Bowie.
		- focuses more on the particular song rather than David Bowie as an artist.
3. Very commonly used in **scientific texts, fiction, and news stories**

##### Converting from active to passive voice
- A clause following S-V-O can be made passive by taking the object of a sentence and making it into the subject of the sentence, i.e. placing it at the beginning.

- You maintain the same tense of the active form when converting to passive form.

- You often omit the agent (the subject in the active form) because the focus is on the object.

Teaching:  Teach the passive form by getting the students to write a news article using a formal register.
