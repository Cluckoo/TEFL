These are tools that guide the reader by linking together ideas across sentences. These can include:

- **[[Reference cohesion|Reference]]:** _this, that, these, those, he, she, it_ ^9cf1eb
- **Substitution & ellipsis:** _do so, one, …_ (leaving words out when understood)
- **[[Conjunctions]]:** _and, but, although, because_
- **[[Lexical cohesion]]:** repeating or using related words (_car → vehicle → it_) ^dd0826

One category of cohesive devices are discourse markers, which are words or phrases that connect ideas. These can include:

- **Adding:** _furthermore, moreover, in addition_
- **Contrasting:** _however, on the other hand, yet_
- **Sequencing:** _firstly, next, finally_
- **Reformulating/clarifying:** _in other words, that is to say_

Spoken discourse markers are also really important, and can include words like:
- like
- anyway
- right
- okay
- so
