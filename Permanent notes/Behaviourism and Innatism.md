##### Context
In the 1960s and early 1970s, a number of factors contributed to changes in language teaching, moving away from behaviourist principles. Two examples are:
1. The perceived need to improve adults' foreign language proficiency in order to promote European integration.
2. Developments in linguistics, which led to a rejection of the structuralist view of language. This saw language primarily as a set of related structures which need to be mastered in order to learn a language.
##### Innatism
- Noam Chomsky rejected the view of language and language learning underlying the then current methods of language learning, stating: “Language is not a habit structure. Ordinary linguistic behaviour characteristically involves innovation, formation of new sentences and patterns in accordance with rules of great abstractness and intricacy.” (1966)
- Chomsky proposed that all languages have an underlying shared universal grammar, and that humans are born with an innate capacity to acquire language (LAD - Language Acquisition Device). 
- Additionally, work in various fields, such as the philosophy of language, sociolinguistics and functional linguistics, contributed to a view that language was primarily about communicating meaning rather than about a series of related grammatical structures.

##### Behaviourism
- In the 1950s and 60s, behaviourism was applied to language learning
- Behaviourist theory of SLA (second language acquisition) emerged:
	- The foreign language learner is the organism whose behavior is being conditioned.
	- The behavior is verbal behavior.
	- The stimulus is what is taught or presented of the foreign language.
	- The response is the learner’s reaction to the stimulus.
	- The reinforcement includes approval and praise from the teacher and fellow students, as well as self-satisfaction.
- Led to development of [[Audiolingualism]]

##### Why behaviourism fell out of favour
- General dissatisfaction with level reached in L2 by students
	- Students couldn't use L2 effectively outside classroom
	- Drilling and repetition was boring
