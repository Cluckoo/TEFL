A clause is a group of words that includes a subject and a verb. They can be further broken down into phrases. For example, the verb in a clause may be a verb phrase.

Usually a clause has something that follows the subject and verb. The other parts of a clause can be categorised as object, adverbial or complement.
- Object: My lovely little boy made / a birthday cake.
- [[Adverbials|Adverbial]]: This incredibly old man jumped / onto the table.
- Complement: I felt so sad

##### Exceptions for a clause:
Certain types of clauses can omit the subject or verb:
1. Exclamations. Can forgo the verb.
	- What a shame!
- Imperatives: Can forgo the subject.
	- Sit down!

##### Types of clauses
There are two types of clauses:
1. Independent/main clause
	- expresses a complete thought
- Dependent/subordinate clause
	- doesn't express a complete thought
	- usually starts with a (subordinating) conjunction

##### Subordinate clauses/relative pronouns
Subordinate clauses must start with a subordinating conjunction (see below) or relative pronoun (who/which/that).
- Clauses starting with a relative pronoun are adjective clauses. They add more information about the object. If the clause clarifies a general noun, it is essential and doesn't require a comma. If it doesn't clarify a general noun, then it doesn't require a comma: ^0a259e
	- Essential: "I smiled at the girl who was behind me in line"
	- Non-essential: "My friend, who was waiting in line, saw me and waved"


##### Subordinating conjunctions
There are many subordinating conjunctions, but here is a way to remember some common ones:
- A WHITE BUS - although, whenever, if, though, even if, because, unless, since
