#U2
Some games that can be used to teach students how to use dictionaries include:
1. Word formation: ask students to look up a word, and then as many as they can in the same word family 
2. Word of the day: have a new word everyday which students can look up in their own time
3. Dictionary quiz: create a quiz that requires students to use the dictionary to find the meaning/spelling/collocation of words.
