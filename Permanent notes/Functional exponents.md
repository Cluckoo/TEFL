#U6
These are all the different ways to express the same function. 

Asking to open the window is a specific request, but you can see how the first three exponents can be used for any request:

1. I wonder if you'd mind (opening the window)?
2. Would you mind (opening the window)?
3. (Open the window). *IMPERATIVE*
4. It's a bit stuffy in here, isn't it?
