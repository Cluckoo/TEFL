#U7
This is a technique where students repeat what the teacher has said to practise their pronunciation. 

#### Types of drilling

###### Choral drilling
Students repeat in "chorus". Doing it together means students are less afraid of making mistakes since it isn't too obvious if they say it wrong.
###### Substitution drilling
Students are prompted to change a part of the sentence when repeating. E.g., change the pronoun of a sentence:

Teacher: "not *I am* eating a sandwich, but *he*..."
Students: "he is eating a sandwich"
Teacher: "good, now *they*"
Students: "They are eating sandwiches"
