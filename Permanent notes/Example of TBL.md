## Task 1: Getting to know your resources

**Level:** Pre-intermediate and above

**Goal**: Find out what resources are available to them and how they can use their resource room.

It is assumed in this lesson that your school has the following student resources; books (graded readers), video, magazines and Internet. Don’t worry if it doesn’t, the lesson can be adjusted accordingly.

**Pre-task preparation:** One of the tasks is a video exercise which involves viewing a movie clip with the sound turned off. This can be any movie depending on availability, but the clip has to involve a conversation between two people.

**Pre-task activity:** In pairs students discuss the following questions:

- Do you use English outside the classroom?
- How?
- What ways can you practise English outside the classroom?

**Stage one - Running dictation**  
Put the text from worksheet one on the wall either inside or outside the classroom. Organize your students into pairs. One student will then go to the text, read the text and then go back to her partner and relay the information to her. The partner who stays at the desk writes this information. When teams have finished check for accuracy. You can make this competitive should you wish.

**Stage two**  
In pairs students then read the Getting To Know Your Resources task sheet (worksheet two). Check any problem vocabulary at this stage. This worksheet can be adapted according to the resource room at your school.

- **Stage three**  
    Depending on how the resources are organized in your centre, students then go, in pairs, to the resource room or wherever the resources are kept and complete the tasks on the task sheet.
- **Stage four**  
    Working with a different partner students now compare and share their experience.
- **Stage five - Feedback** 
    Having monitored the activity and the final stage, use this opportunity to make comments on your students’ performance. This may take form of a correction slot on errors or pronunciation, providing a self-correction slot.
