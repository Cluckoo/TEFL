There are two main past verb forms in English:

1. **Past Simple**
2. **Past Participle**

For **regular verbs**, the past simple and past participle forms are the same.  
For **irregular verbs**, the two forms can be different.

| Form                | Regular Verb  | Irregular Verb |
| ------------------- | ------------- | -------------- |
| **Past simple**     | killed        | saw            |
| **Past participle** | (have) killed | (have) seen    |

- The **past simple** is used to talk about completed actions in the past.
- The **past participle** is used with _have/has/had_ (perfect tenses) and sometimes with _be_ (passive voice).
- The past participle appears in **past, present, and future** perfect tenses.
