Presenting the vocabulary needed for an upcoming activity is called vocabulary pre-teaching. To choose an appropriate vocabulary list, you should:
1. Use vocabulary from the appropriate CEFR level
2. Vocabulary relevant to the class (reason why they're learning English)
3. How many words (a good number is 10-12; children less)

E.g., an adult class will find the phrase "has gained weight" very useful, but not "has become fatter". The latter is too simplistic.
