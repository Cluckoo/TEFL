#U5

| Stage | Activity |
|-------|----------|
| **1** | Introduce topic (warmer/lead-in). |
| **2** | Pre-teach vocabulary. |
| **3** | Set a simple gist task â†’ students read quickly for general meaning. Short time limit. First reading + feedback. |
| **4** | Set detailed questions/task. Allow more time. Second reading + feedback. |
| **5** | Follow-up activities (speaking or writing). |
The first three stages are important for establishing context, so help with the students' [[Top-down vs bottom-up processing]] of the text.
