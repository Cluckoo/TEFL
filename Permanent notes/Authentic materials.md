##### Caution against using authentic materials:
- Too advanced
- No relevance to reason for learning English
- Cultural insensitivity (news)
- **Topics including drugs, sex, religion or politics may offend your boss, your students, their parents or even the government**

But, authentic materials are very helpful for those planning to spend time in the UK/USA. E.g., GP application forms, London underground tickets.
