##### Caution against using authentic materials:
- Too advanced
- No relevance to reason for learning English
- Cultural insensitivity (news)
- **Topics including drugs, sex, religion or politics may offend your boss, your students, their parents or even the government**

But, authentic materials are very helpful for those planning to spend time in the UK/USA. E.g., GP application forms, London underground tickets.

##### Pros of using authentic texts
- Exposure to other accents
- Sense of achievement
- Engaging and relevant
- Up-to-date
##### Selecting and using authentic texts
You should choose texts relevant to your students' interests. However, if a text is too advanced, you can still use it as a semi-authentic by simplifying the text to your student's level

**Step 1:** Choose a real-world situation.

**Step 2:** Select theme, context and specific situation.

**Step 3:** Backward plan by asking yourself these questions.

- What will students know or be able to do at the end of this lesson?
- What vocabulary words, expressions or sentences will they need to learn in order to do this?
- What authentic materials would I use if I were in this real-world situation?
