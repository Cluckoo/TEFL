An **adverb** is a **word** or **phrase** that **modifies the meaning of another part of the sentence**. Adverbs can modify adjectives (very red), verbs (he talks slowly), or other adverbs (incredibly slowly).

They express:
- manner (fast)
	- usually describe verbs (adverbs of manner)
- place (here)
- time (tomorrow)
- or degree (slightly)

##### Types of adverbs:
- Sentence adverbs: modify the whole sentence
	- Unfortunately
	- In my opinion
- Time adverbs
	- Frequency adverbs
		- Definite frequency (daily, weekly)
		- Indefinite frequency (always, never, sometimes)
##### Adverb order
- Adverbs must come before what they are modifying. So adverbs that modify another adverb must come before it. E.g., "Really very interesting"
- Indefinite frequency adverbs come after the verb and object, while definite frequency adverbs come before.
	- I ride my bike daily
	- I always ride my bike
##### Pairing adverbs and adjectives
- The rules of what adverbs can come before an adjective is dependent on meaning and collocation.
##### -ly adverbs
- Single word adverbs are usually formed by combining:
	- Adjective
	- and -ly ending
- Some adjectives do not form adverbs by adding -ly. There is no rule for this, learners just have to memorise which adjectives are irregular. E.g.,
	- Fast, hard, well, late
-
