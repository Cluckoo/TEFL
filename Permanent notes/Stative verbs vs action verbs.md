#### Stative verbs
Stative/state verbs are verbs that describe a **state of being**, **thought**, **emotion**, **possession**, or **sense** rather than an action. They usually refer to something **static** (unchanging) rather than dynamic.

###### State verbs are not normally used in continuous forms:

> They are seeming tired. They **seem** tired.

However, some stative verbs can take continuous forms when referring to a temporary action, or an action in progress:

> I **'m having** second thoughts about moving abroad.  
- Jones **is appearing** in Hamlet this evening.

Or, with a different meaning. E.g.,:

| I **expect** that you are tired. (assume)        | **Are** you **expecting** visitors this evening? (waiting for them to arrive) |
| I **feel** that you are wrong. (think)           | How **have** you **been feeling**? (asking about physical state)              |
| This melon **weighs** 2 kg. (its weight is 2 kg) | He **is weighing** the melon. (measuring its weight)                          |

#### Action verbs
Action verbs (also called dynamic verbs) express activities, processes, momentary actions or physical conditions:
