These are the two approaches to grammar lessons. Inductive teaching is the accepted way for language teaching. The deductive approach is reserved for quick revision.

##### The deductive approach
This is where the teacher gives the abstract rules first, and then introduces supporting examples.

##### The inductive approach
The teacher sets a context, and tries to elicit the grammar rules from the students:
1. Context
2. Elicit target language (rules and structures)
3. Pronunciation

##### Advantages and disadvantages of each

| Type of approach | Advantages                                                    | Disadvantages                                                              |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Deductive        | Easy to plan and teach                                        | Difficult for students to follow abstract rules                            |
|                  | Quick way to revise language student's already know           | Reduced exposure to English if rules explained in students' L1             |
|                  | Some students prefer this academic approach                   | Dry and unengaging for students                                            |
| Inductive        | Students must engage, allowing teacher to gauge understanding | Can be patronising for adult students to "repeat things in chorus"         |
|                  | Students actively use English when engaging                   | Stronger students may always respond, making weaker students feel left out |
|                  | Meaning of target language is clear through the context       | Difficult for teacher to predict what students will say                    |
