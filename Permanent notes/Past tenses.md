These are tenses that refer to an action that has already occurred. Tenses using the auxiliaries **had**, **was**, and **were** are referred to as past forms.

- Used to describe actions, states, or events that happened before the present moment.
- Can describe **finished actions**, **ongoing past actions**, or **actions completed before another past event**.
- Signal words often include: _yesterday, last week, in 1990, ago, when, while_

Note that the conjugation of verbs can be different for the past simple, and when the verb is a past participle [[Past verb forms]].

##### Politeness and distance
The past simple and continuous are used to create distance from reality or social distance. The distance from reality means it can be used to talk about hypothetical situations. Social distance means it shows politeness.
