##### Context
- **The Natural Approach**Â was based on Stephen Krashen's theories of second language acquisition (L2A), which were developed through his research (with Heidi Dulay and Marina Burt) into the way people learned foreign languages.
- Krashen proposes the Input Hypothesis:  there is a natural process by which we acquire second languages: all that is needed is adequate exposure to 'comprehensible input' in stress-free situations, and the L2 will be acquired in much the same way as children learn their first language.
- Krashen draws a distinction between the type of learning involved in this natural process, which he calls acquisition, and the conscious study of language rules, which he calls learning. Krashen and Terrell argue that students should be allowed a 'silent period' in which they can acquire new language but are not required to produce it
##### What is it?
