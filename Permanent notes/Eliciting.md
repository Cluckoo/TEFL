This is a technique where teachers draw out information from the class such as either:
1. Examples of the TL
2. How the piece of TL works

Usually, this technique is paired with [[Concept-checking questions]], to check that other individual students understand the meaning of the TL.

##### Tips for eliciting
- Don't correct language when learners are volunteering background information about a topic — communication, not accuracy, is important here.
- To avoid stronger students dominating, nominate who will answer questions. 
- Long silences or incorrect answers suggest that input is needed from the teacher.
- Acknowledge each contribution with gestures or comments.

##### Possible caveats to avoid when eliciting
- Spending too long eliciting, and taking away student talking time
- Overusing the technique, leading to it becoming pointless
