| Verbal and non-verbal    | Verbal – can be by explaining to the student where they have gone wrong, or stating the correct way the word or phrase should be spoken. <br><br>Non-verbal – can be through facial expression or body language or hand gestures.                                          |
| Finger Correction        | This involves assigning a finger to represent each word within a given phrase or sentence. To indicate to students how the system works, a teacher can point to or move each finger as they relay the sentence to the student or class, identifying the wrong word spoken. |
| Self - Correction        | The student is given the opportunity to make the correction after the teacher has drawn attention to his or her error.                                                                                                                                                     |
| Peer Correction          | A teacher can invite other students in a class to correct a phrase, word, pronunciation etc.                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Teacher Correction       | A teacher explains where the student has gone wrong and gives the student the correct answer.<br><br>A teacher writes the correct word or sentence on a board in a classroom.                                                                                              |

##### Self-correction
The teacher often use an error key when marking written work, guiding the student to their error, rather than directly telling them. 

##### Finger correction
Helpful to point out an extra word or a missing word in a sentence.

##### Post-activity correction
When you have a fluency activity, such as at the production stage of PPP, you can collect up errors and make them into a game. Maybe the whole class corrects the errors together.
