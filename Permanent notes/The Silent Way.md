#U8 
##### Context
- Extreme take on the idea that the lesson should involve student-student interactions rather than the teacher addressing the class. Teacher is almost completely silent.
- Idea that learning is more likely to occur when students discover things for themselves instead of simply repeating and memorising information.

##### What is it?
- Teacher remains silent, acting as a "facilitator"
- Teacher sets problem for students to solve together, requiring communication
- Emphasis on pronunciation. with teacher pointing to pronunciation chart
