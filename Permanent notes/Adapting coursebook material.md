You should selectively adapt and edit materials to better fit your learners.

## Steps to Adapt Coursebook Material

1. **Adapt the introduction to the topic to fit your class**

2. **Vocabulary Presentation**
    - Elicit from students (books closed).
    - Avoid over-reliance on matching/definition tasks.
        
3. **Ensure vocab is the appropriate level and narrow down which ones to teach**
        
4. **Pre-teaching Vocabulary**
    - Always pre-teach before reading/listening.
    - Add a pre-teach task if missing.
        
5. **Reading/Listening Tasks**
    - Ensure a gist task comes first (get overall meaning of the text).
    - Avoid jumping straight to detail questions.
        
6. **Follow-on Activities**
    - Check logical flow from reading/listening.
    - Cut unnecessary tasks (too many for one lesson). Don't worry about stopping in the middle of a page of the coursebook!
