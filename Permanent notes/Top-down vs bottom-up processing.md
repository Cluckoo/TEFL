Readers can understand individual words in a text through a combination of top-down and bottom-up processing:

- Top-down processing involves predicting the words based on the meaning of the text, as well as general and cultural knowledge.
- Bottom-down processing is piecing together the individual sounds and letters to figure out the word.

It can be helpful to teach your students common [[Digraphs and strings]] as this will help them in their bottom-up processing.
