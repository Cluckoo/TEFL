##### Why have Audiolingualism, the Oral Approach, and The Direct Method fallen out of popularity?
Although methods like Audiolingualism and Situational English were clearly based on behaviourist ideas of habit formation, the Direct Method actually predates behaviourism and is more naturalistic. However, all three approaches have fallen out of favour because they tend to prioritise repetition and accuracy over meaningful communication and learner autonomy, which modern communicative approaches value more.
