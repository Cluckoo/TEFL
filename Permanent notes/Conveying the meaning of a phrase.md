A phrase like "to run into someone" cannot be taught literally. You need to teach the meaning, and teach it in context to the students. Here are the overall steps:

###### 1. Create a clear context
- This can be through using it in a sentence with other easier words, or using [[Alternatives to translation for new vocab|images and realia]].
- Alternatively, using things like a cline (scale) (comparing it to known words are helpful). E.g., introducing the word "rarely" along a cline, with the words "always" and "never" defining the extremes.

###### 2. Elicit the meaning
Lead the student to the answer by using questions to nudge them. E.g., after showing a new word in a sentence (honeymoon), you can ask the student:
1. What type of word is it?
2. When does it happen?
3. What kind of verb does it use?
4. So, it's a. ...? (Noun)
- Combine these questions with a **picture** to be extra specific
- For idioms, be sure to include an image that conveys the true meaning (e.g., someone being sick for "under the weather")
###### 3. Use [[Concept-checking questions]]
Especially when using a scenario to teach the vocab

###### 4. Teach the [[Teaching a new word|collocations, and usage features]]
- Often include verbs and prepositions
- Include whether the word has a positive/negative connotation (e.g., slim vs skinny)
- Synonyms vs antonyms

###### 5. Decide whether this word is for [[Receptive and productive vocabulary|productive or receptive vocabulary]]
- If the goal is to add the word to the student's receptive vocabulary, you don't need to provide as much information. You just need the student's to recognise it.

###### 5. DON'T USE UNFAMILAR LANGUAGE!
- Use CEFR as a template for appropriate grade language to explain new words
