##### The aim
- The aim is usually worded as "By the end of the lesson..."
- Ask yourself *"What is the new information or skills the students are learning here?"*
- E.g., - 'By the end of the lesson, students will be better able to understand a TED talk called 'How to Spot a Liar''.

##### The objectives
- Multiple steps to achieve the aim
- E.g.,  ‘students will revise and learn some new words relating to body language and lying’
- Critically evaluate each objective with:
	1. Is it realistic?
	2. Is it measurable?
- Critically evaluate all objectives together with:
	1. Is it necessary?
	2. Is there anything else we should include?

You can use the objectives like a checklist!

Here is an example of aims and objectives:
