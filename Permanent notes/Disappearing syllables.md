These are syllables that often disappear when we say them. In fact, pronouncing the word would make the word sound strange. 

In British English, these all have disappearing syllables:
- aspirin
- average
- business
- camera
- chocolate
- conference
- corporal
- desperate
- different
- every
- general
- family
- favourite
- federal
- history
- interest
- literally
- memory
- mineral
- miserable
- opera
- probably
- separate
- several
- library
- vegetable

However, sometimes different accents result in different pronunciations with disappearing syllables. For example with "comfortable":
- In British English:  cumf-te-bel Ooo
- In American English:  cum-fer-te-bel Oooo
There is an extra syllable in the American pronunciation since they pronnounce their "R" after their vowels.
