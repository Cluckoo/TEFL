The double negative is not used in formal English, so its usage is restricted to dialectal English or rhetorical use:

 -  **Non-standard / dialectal English**
	- In many dialects (e.g., African American Vernacular English, Cockney, some Southern US English), double negatives are used for **emphasis**, not cancellation.

	- Examples:
	    
	    - _I ain’t never been there._ (means: _I have never been there._)
	    - _She didn’t say nothing._ (means: _She didn’t say anything._)
	        
- **Rhetorical / literary use**
	- In literature or formal rhetoric, a “double negative” can be used deliberately to soften or emphasize meaning (sometimes called **litotes**).
    
	- Examples:
	    
	    - _It’s not uncommon for students to struggle with this tense._ (means: _It’s quite common._)
	    - _I can’t not help her._ (means: _I must help her._)

**Three basic rules for using a double negative in English:**

1. Each subject-predicate construction should only have one negative form. E.g. I cannot (negative) go anywhere (positive) tonight.
2. A double negative is a non-standard sentence construction that uses two negative forms.
3. Learning standard English negation is difficult because many languages and some English dialects use double negatives in everyday speech. E.g. No hay ningun problema. (Spanish) “There isn’t no problem.” meaning “There isn’t a problem.”
