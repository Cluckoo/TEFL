#U1
Lessons usually follow a 5 part structure. However the middle three parts (body) are variable:

WARMER - BODY - PLENARY

The BODY can follow the structure of:
1. [[PPP]] (Present, Practice, Produce)
2. [[TTT]] (Test, Teach, Test)
3. [[ESA]] (Engage, Study, Activate)

A typical lesson (55 m) should have 5/6 stages:
1. Warmer (5-10 m)
2. Body (three or four parts | 10-15 m each)
	- [[Attention span|No stage should exceed 20 minutes]]
3. Plenary (10 m)
