Monolingual classes may have difficulty sticking to English, while multilingual classes may have trouble communicating with each other.

Pros of each class:

| Monolingual                                         | Multilingual                                                            |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Students can help each other translate words        | Diverse backgrounds = more talking points                               |
| Shared cultural knowledge                           | Real reason to communicate in English                                   |
| Errors from direct translation are still understood | Must be accurate with pronunciation, grammar and vocab to be understood |
|                                                     |                                                                         |
Cons of each class:

| Monolingual                                                              | Multilingual                                                                             |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Can be uncomfortable to speak in English if they already know each other | Some students may form groups where they speak their native language, leaving others out |
| May never realise errors because they are still understood               | Students may be frustrated by being unable to communicate through direct translation     |
###### Planning for mono vs multilingual classes
- Multilingual classes may require more context when introducing new words as they can't easily check whether they have understood it with their peers.
- Multilingual classes will have background-language-specific struggles. For example, the lack of past tense for Chinese speakers. This may require more explanation / specifically explaining the differences between the languages for the students to grasp.
