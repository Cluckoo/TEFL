Broadly, there are three groups that languages can be placed in based on the timing of speech.

###### 1. Stress-timed
- The duration of time between stressed words are the same
- The unstressed words between stressed words are shortened to maintain the above
- E.g., English, German
###### 2. Syllable-timed
- The duration between each syllable is largely the same
- No syllables are reduced
- E.g., French, Spanish
###### 3. Mora-timed
- The timing of each sound is defined by a mora (the smallest unit defining the length of a sound)
- Some sounds are one mora, while others are two
- E.g., Japanese
