English is a S-V-O language. This means clauses follow the order of:
1. Subject
2. Verb
3. Object

However, all clauses in English can follow 7 basic patterns:

| Pattern       | Example                                     |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| S + V         | She / left.                                 |
| S + V + O     | Selena / read / the letter.                 |
| S + V + C     | Marina / is / sad.                          |
