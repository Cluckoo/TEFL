#U7
Just like [[Recycling vocabulary]], for students to remember new grammar, they need to revisit it at increasingly longer intervals. Just like vocabulary, grammar likely needs to be revisited at least 5-16 times.

New grammar must be recycled in different contexts and [[Language components vs skills|skills]].

Minigames for vocabulary revision can be adapted for grammar, and structures can be placed in the vocabulary box too!
