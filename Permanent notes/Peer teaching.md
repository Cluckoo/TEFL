#U1
Opportunity for a high-ability student to teach a lower-ability student. But, students can take turns in the "tutor and tutee" roles.

Can be done using the **Think-Pair-Share** structure:
1. Think: pose a question and give a few minutes for students to jot down answers
2. Pair: Get students to discuss what they think and why
3. Share: Ask pairs to share ideas with whole class
