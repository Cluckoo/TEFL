**Adjectives describe, or tell us more about, a noun**.

##### Lists of adjectives
You can use more than one adjective before a noun; you must separate each with a comma. However, the order these adjectives come must follow an order:
1. Quantity or number (e.g. five, some)
2. Opinion/quality (e.g. fine, beautiful, awful)
3. Size (e.g. big, small)
4. Age (e.g. young, middle-aged)
5. Shape (e.g. round, triangular)
6. Colour (e.g. black, blue)
7. Origin (e.g. British, Yorkshire)
8. Material (e.g. silk, plastic)
9. Purpose (e.g. sewing, knitting)

The exception to this order is when there is a compound noun. The compound noun consists of an adjective that shouldn't be split from the noun. So, the adjective must come last, regardless of the order. E.g.,
- High school student

##### Types of adjectives
- Superlative and comparative
	- Comparative (-er)
		- Compares one thing with another
	- Superlative (-est)
		- Compares one thing to everything else
The exception to these changes in spellings for comparative and superlative adjectives is for one of two reasons:
1. The adjective is two or more syllables.
	- Two syllables means if it ends in -y, you change the spelling
	- Three syllables or more means almost always use more/most
2. The adjective is **ABSOLUTE**. This means they cannot be graded (they are all-or-nothing). E.g.,
	- Perfect, infinite, eternal, dead.

##### Adjectives and linking verbs
- Adjectives can come before the noun, or after a linking verb.
	- The pretty girl
	- She seems pretty
- Linking verbs allow us to add more information to the subject. E.g.,
	- Appear, be, become, feel, remain, seem.
- Adjectives, NOT adverbs follow linking verbs since the information added is about the subject. The verb is not really an action.
