Prepositions are words that convey location or position in time and space. There are 150 prepositions in English, with 94 being single-word.

##### Prepositions in phrases
- Prepositions often collocate with set verbs to form certain meanings. E.g.,
	- interested **in**
	- spend money **on**

##### True preposition
- A true preposition is always **followed by a nounÂ or a pronoun**.
	- Prepositions in phrases as seen above are true prepositions since they are followed by nouns
- Prepositions can also come after verbs to form **phrasal verbs**. These are not true prepositions. E.g.,
	- Turn the lights on, speak up
	- These are not true prepositions, but rather (particle) adverbs
- Verbs in the **infinitive** form use "to" before the verb. Here, "to" is not a true preposition either.
