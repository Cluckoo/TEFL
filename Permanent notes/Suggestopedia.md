#U8 
##### Context
- influenced both by Soviet psychology and yoga
- based on subliminal learning

##### What is it?
- Students learnt in relaxed atmosphere:
	- comfortable armchairs
	- nice lighting
	- classical music
- Teacher plays authoritarian teacher-student relationship
- In a Suggestopedia lesson, music is played in the background while the teacher reads a fairly long text twice, typically a dialogue, and the students just listen. The idea is that this promotes subliminal learning. The students are then given a copy of the text with the translation, and the next part of the lesson focuses on language work.
