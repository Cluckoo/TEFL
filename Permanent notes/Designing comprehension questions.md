#U5
Decide whether you want to focus on scanning or skimming.

##### Lower level students
You can create recognition-based questions, where you ask factual questions on the text such as:
- Where was Jessica on her way to when she got the email?
- What did the email say?
- Was she shocked?
- Had she realised she'd done it?

##### Advanced level students
Devise questions that can't easily be plucked out of the text. They require readers to think about their own responses to the text:

- _Why do you think the communication from the university would have been particularly upsetting for Jessica?_
	This requires understanding of the phrase 'on her way to a funeral', and students need to think about Jessica's feelings in that situation.

- _What does plagiarising an essay mean?_
	This checks understanding of 'plagiarise'.
	
- _Why was she so surprised? Answer this question without repeating words from the text._
	This checks understanding of 'shocked' and requires students to rephrase 'I hadn’t realised I’d done it,' which they will not be able to do if they don't understand it.
	
- _Do you think Jessica had done anything wrong?_
