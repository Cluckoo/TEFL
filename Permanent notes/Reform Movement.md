At the same time as the Direct Method was developing and gaining popularity, a movement known as the Reform Movement developed in Europe. It was members of this movement who founded the International Phonetic Association in 1886.

The IP association wanted to improve foreign language teaching and some of their teaching principles are similar to those of the [[Direct method]].

British linguist, Henry Sweet, who was part of the Reform Movement, believed that sound teaching methods would be based on linguistic analysis and psychological study. This belief identified two crucial elements that inform all approaches to language teaching:
1. a view of what language is and
2. a view of how learning takes place. 

Although language teachers may often be unaware of their own views on these two matters, unconscious assumptions about how language operates and how we learn undoubtedly inform the way we teach.
