The IPA phonetic chart for English pronunciation is based on RP. However, this accent has fallen out of use, and so different pronunciations may be better.

##### Words ending in -y, -i, -ey, -ie(s)
- These words end in a vowel sound between /i:/ and /I/
- This in between sound is represented by /i/
##### /əʊ/ VS /oʊ/
- The [[IPA in English|phonetic chart]] has /əʊ/ as the pronunciation for "go".
- Nowadays, most British speakers will pronounce this sound as /oʊ/
- This is a rounder "oh" sound
##### /aɪ/ VS /ʌɪ/
- The [[IPA in English|phonetic chart]] has /aɪ/ for "buy"
- British speakers use /aɪ/, but some accents (like Canadian) use /ʌɪ/
##### /ʊə/ VS /ɔː/
- The [[IPA in English|phonetic chart]] has /ʊə/ for "pure"
- This is unique to the RP accent
- Most British speakers would now use /ɔː/ like "saw"
