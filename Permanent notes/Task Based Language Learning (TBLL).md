##### Context
- [[Example of TBL]]
- a very student-centred approach as the students work out how to complete the task themselves
- in the 'strong' version of TBLL â€“ they use whatever language they want to when doing the task.
- 'weaker' versions of TBLL have emerged where the task is treated more like a PPP lesson. In the weaker versions, the teacher presents the vocabulary and grammar they feel the students will need for the task at the beginning of the lesson before students are asked to do the task.

##### What is it?
- A very student-centred approach where students learn by working out how to complete the task themselves. Task examples;
	- Create a YouTube video
	- Create a marketing campaign
	- Write a movie review
- Tasks must have clear and measurable outcomes
- Stages:
	- pre-task (preparation)
	- task
	- evaluation
- In the original approach, the language that naturally emerged during the task is studied after completion of the task
