#### TTT
For reinforcing grammar points that have already been taught, TTT is better
	- Test: controlled/freer practice to gauge level
	- Teach: same as presentation in PPP, but tailored based on test stage
	- Test: more practice activities

#### TBLL
This is called task-based language learning. Students focus on a task, rather than the target language. They then review language used during the task afterwards. This is a natural way to learn language.

There are 3 stages:
1. Pre-task (teacher explains what to do)
2. Task (Task -> Planning -> Report to class)
3. Review

The task can be anything from playing a game, solving a problem, to sharing information. Students can use any language they want during the task. A balance should be kept between fluency, which is what the task provides, and accuracy, which is provided by task feedback.

The main advantages of TBL are:
- that language is used for a genuine purpose meaning that real communication should take place, 
- when preparing their report for the whole class, students are forced to consider language form in general rather than concentrating on a single form (as in the PPP model).
- flexibility in range of tasks
- provides transition from fluency to fluency + accuracy
