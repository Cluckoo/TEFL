As well as stress within individual words, there is the stress across a sentence. Individual words become more stressed within a sentence.

However, within the "stressed words", the [[Word stress|stress]] must still be on the correct syllable:
- "E==**laine**== de==**cid**==ed to re==**quest**== a ==**re**==fund"

The content words are usually stressed, while structure words are not. This is because content words carry the meaning of the sentence. I.e., verbs, nouns, adjectives, and adverbs are stressed, while pronouns and prepositions usually aren't.

E.g.,
##### **This** is the **house** that **Jack built.**
- Even though there are two syllables between "this" and "house", they are shortened so that the timing between the other stressed syllables are the same. 



Note: you can still stress specific words in a sentence to change the meaning
