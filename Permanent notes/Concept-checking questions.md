Concept-checking questions, or CCQs are questions you ask a student to check if they understood the meaning of a word. 

CCQs:
- should be closed questions and require simple answers (not open-ended; Yes/No)
- should include simple, graded language
- can be used in conjunction with images
- You should think of good CCQs as part of the lesson plan!

Teacher: "My pants fell down in the middle of London City Centre. How did I feel?"
Students: "Embarassed"

Teacher asks CCQs to ensure they understand:
1. Did I feel silly? (Yes)
2. Was I comfortable? (No)
3. What colour was my face? (Red)
4. Were people watching me? (Yes)
##### Never use questions like:
- What does X mean?
- Do you understand?
Because it may be difficult to define abstract words, especially in a student's second language. These questions don't really check whether the students understand.
