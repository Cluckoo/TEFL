#U8 
##### Context
- Based on idea that L1 is acquired through imperatives, and that L2 can be learnt in the same way.
- Imperative commands require a physical response from the child.
- TPR is intended only for the early stages of second language
- Similar to [[The Natural Approach]], where students only produce language when ready
- Similar to [[Audiolingualism]], as learning theory is behaviourist
##### What is it?
- Students are taught solely through imperatives which they must obey:
	- stand up, 
	- walk to the window, 
	- touch your nose, 
	- etc.
