A pronoun is a word that stands in for a noun to avoid repetition.

##### Persons of pronouns
- English pronouns can be first, second, or third person

##### Types of pronoun (subject vs object form)
- Subject = performing the action
- Object = recipient of the action

| Subject   | Object     |
| --------- | ---------- |
| I         | Me         |
| You       | You        |
| He/She/It | Him/Her/It |
| We        | Us         |
| They      | Them       |
##### Possessive pronouns
- These are pronouns that indicate possession
- They can replace whole noun phrases
	- Is that Phillip’s book?
	- No, it's _mine_. (replaces: No, it's my book.)

| Subject   | Object     | Possessive pronoun |
| --------- | ---------- | ------------------ |
| I         | Me         | Mine               |
| You       | You        | Yours              |
| He/She/It | Him/Her/It | His/Hers/Its       |
| We        | Us         | Ours               |
| They      | Them       | Theirs             |
- Do not confuse these with possessive adjectives which also indicate possession, but do not replace noun phrases.
